    In a square grid world with four colored squares (R(ed), G(reen), Y(ellow),
    B(lue)), the agent must drive a taxi to various passengers' locations and
    drop them off at the passenger's desired location at one of the four squares.

    and dropped off, and receives negative reward for doing an inappropriate
    action (eg. dropping off the passenger at the incorrect location, attempting
    to pick up a passenger on an empty square, etc.).

    There are six possible actions, corresponding to four navigation actions
    (move North, South, East, and West), a pickup action, and a dropoff action.

    The observation space is a single state index, which encodes the possible
    states accounting for the taxi position, location of the passenger, and four
